      <description>As a result of my Master&amp;rsquo;s Project research, we were able to develop a new extension of EM Algorithm, able to cluster observations evolving in time.
The .gif at the top illustrates the process of training of the Algorithm. The dataset consists of 220 United Nation countries, divided with respect to gender, red &amp;ndash; female, blue &amp;ndash; male. Three corners of the Ternary plot represent proportions of Single, Married and Widowed citizens, with respect to age (time).</description>

      <description>As a part of a bigger project, I wrote Support Vector Machine Classifier. It supports multiclass clasification, linear and radial kernels, and both hard and soft margins.

      <description>This picture shows what the first and the last convolutional layer detect when a network is feeded with a picture of a person.
For two weeks my two colleagues and I have been working on a group project, whose goal is to compare the performance of different algorithms in face recognition. We are focused on SVMs with different kernels and convnets. One more goal is to use data augmentation and transfer learning methods to train a network even on a very small data set.</description>

      <description>My biggest project this year is going to be my Master&amp;rsquo;s Project. In it I extend the possibilities of the EM algorithm to cluster Dirichlet distributed data evolving in time. Project consists of a number of steps:
 Programming a simple EM algorithm for normally distrubuted data Adjusting the algorithm for the dirichlet distribution Developing the model suitable for a data consisting of observations evolving in time Testing the algorithm on a synthetic data set Cleaning and preparing a real-life data set - marital statuses in countries in different group ages Applying the algorithm for the real data  The .</description>

      <description>Another project I have made concerns my childhood hobby: the game of chess. This famous data set contains coordinates of three pieces on a chessboard: white king, white rook and black king and optimal depth-of-win for White in 0 to 16 moves, otherwise drawn, assuming that Black moves first.

      <description>I have uploaded on github my first data science project, called Stone Flakes. It concerns the earliest history of mankind, investigating stone flakes, the waste product of the tools&#39; crafting process. The main question related to the data set is: &amp;ldquo;Does the data reflect the technological progress during several hundred thousand years?” Check out:

      <description>My name is Szymon Steczek. Feel free to pronounce my name as Simon. My whole professional life has been dedicated to mathematics and since few years, I am discovering the beauty and potential in data science.
my short history I was born in Cracow, a fascinating city in southern Poland. There I have obtained a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Applied Mathematics at AGH University of Science and Technology. In 2020 I was accepted to the Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics Department at University of Minnesota as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.</description>
